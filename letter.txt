Dear editor

Please find a manuscript attached describing the PconsC4 pipeline used
for predicting the structure of proteins without any known
homologs. We have tried to describe it in such a detail so that it
should be easy for a user to set it up themself. We have tried to
highlight potential cases when the pipeline does not provide optimal
results.


Yours

Arne Elofsson - on behalf of all the authors

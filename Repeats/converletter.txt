Dear Editor, 


Thanks for providing us the opportunity to submit a substatially
revised version of the manuscript PCOMPBIOL-D-19-01834.
 

To fullfill your requirements we expand our paper including predictions
made with Deep Meta Psicov however we could not use RaptorX and the
method described by reference 17 because the first is available only
as web server that does not support , despite is available, is not
working at the moment.

The main concern of reviewers 1 and 2 is that, while it is noteworthy
that the deep NN learning of contacts allows PconsC4 to model repeat
proteins much better than the direct-coupling approach GaussDCA, no
comparison to state-of-the-art methods such as RaptorX (Xu lab) or
ResTriplet (Zhang lab) or DMPfold (Jones lab) is done. Reviewers 2 and
3 also criticised that no attempt to correct for the specific,
systematic noise in contact predictions arising from doublicated
repeats, as described in ref (17), has been developed to specifically
improve the structure prediction of repeat proteins.

Yours

Arne Elofsson and Claudio Bassot
